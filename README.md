# EQbuddy

EQbuddy is a Shoes-based application which is designed to modernize the home teaching assignment process. It's first goal is to meet the criteria outlined in this tech.lds.org forum [discussion](http://tech.lds.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=14738&hilit=home+teaching+program&sid=ec037248f91e33bf0f2c1849c66493ec.)

The upshot of this discussion is, a third party HT/VT app must:

1. Be off-line compatible
2. Not store any church data on a 3rd party server
3. Be a stand alone desktop application
4. Must be developed for Windows, Mac and Linux

EQbuddy is written entirely using the Shoes library. That means it can be exported as a a stand-alone app and installed either on a home computer or a clerk's office computer.

It can pull membership information from lds.org, or it can import it from MLS if an internet connection is not available.
